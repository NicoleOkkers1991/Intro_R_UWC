# Introduction to R Workshop Weekend Exercises
# Weekend Exercise 3: 
# Section 3: (this what you did on the first day with AJ)
# Make use of the SACTN_day1 data: 
# Here create a graph showing temperature variation between sites
# Select all the temperatures recorded at the site Port Nolloth during August or September.
# Select all the monthly temperatures recorded in Port Nolloth during the year 1994
# Calculate the average temperature by depth (Maybe by site)
# Work through the tidyverse section within the document. Show what you have done by creating comments/ notes throughout the script
